# AGV CONTROL

AGV Control is an Mobile application designed for dynamic control and visualization of mobile robotic system operated by the Robot Operating System (ROS). The application uses ROS nodes initializing publisher and subscriber with standard ROS messages. The overall code architecture pattern is Model View ViewModel (MVVM), which stabilizes the Application and makes it highly customizable. Application Display Metrics And Location Of the Bot.
#### How it works
- The Anonymous Robot Which Run By Mutiple Nodes Have Metric Data .You Can veiw Nodes through [Design Architecture](https://github.com/gokulmaxi/flipkart-challenge)
- The Application Get Metric Data From Mutiple Nodes Through  ```MQTT``` and ```TCP```
- The Application also Stimulates The Robot Using Location-Streaming-Camera In Application
- The Metric Data Like Bot State ,Bot Movement ,Bot Location and Bot Health etc Can be Viewed Through The Application
